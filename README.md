## About
I am a reliable, dedicated and fully bilingual (Frenchâ€“English) Canadian citizen. I thrive when faced with a challenge and I perform well under pressure. I am eager to learn as I crave knowledge. I am intelligent, motivated and skilled in a variety of mathematical fields with programming experience in C/C++, Python, R, Matlab, Fortran, Maple and automation frameworks.

## Education
Bachelor of Mathematics in Honours Mathematical Physics at the University of Waterloo (2020).

Candidate for a Master of Mathematics (Applied Math) at the University of Waterloo (2022).

## Research
My current research interests concern the evolution and stability of various flows in electrically conducting fluids (such as plasmas). The bulk of my research experience has been the numerical study of the Shallow-Water equations and it's generalization to magnetohydrodynamics (MHD).
