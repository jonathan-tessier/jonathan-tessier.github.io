## About
#### I am a reliable, dedicated and fully bilingual (Frenchâ€“English) Canadian citizen. I thrive when faced with a challenge and I perform well under pressure. I am eager to learn as I crave knowledge. I am intelligent, motivated and skilled in a variety of mathematical fields with programming experience in C/C++, Python, R, Matlab, Fortran, Maple and automation frameworks.

## Education
#### Bachelor of Mathematics in Honours Mathematical Physics at the University of Waterloo (2020).

#### Candidate for a Master of Mathematics (Applied Math) at the University of Waterloo (2022).

## Research
#### My current research interests concern the stability of various flows in Geophysical Flows and Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The bulk of my research experience has been the numerical study of the Shallow-Water equations and it's MHD counter parts.

## Publications
#### Tessier, J., Castro-Folker, N., Poulin, F.J., Stastna, M. (2021). Anisotropy in Faraday Instabilities Generated by the Time-Dependent Gravitational Forcing of a Shallow Conducting Fluid. Manuscript in preparation.
