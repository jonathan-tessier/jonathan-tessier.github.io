## About
#### I am a reliable, dedicated and fully bilingual (French–English) Canadian citizen. I thrive when faced with a challenge and I perform well under pressure. I am eager to learn as I crave knowledge. I am intelligent, motivated and skilled in a variety of mathematical fields with programming experience in Python, Matlab, Julia, C/C++, Fortran, R, Maple and automation frameworks. I am currently completing a PhD in Oceanography at l'Université du Québec à Rimouski, studying conceptual models of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC).

## Education
#### Bachelor of Mathematics in Honours Mathematical Physics at the University of Waterloo (2020).

#### Master of Mathematics (Applied Math) at the University of Waterloo (2022).

#### Candidate for a PhD in Oceanography (Physical Oceanography) at l'Université du Québec à Rimouski (UQAR).

## Research
#### I am curerntly interested in conceptual models the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) for my PhD. I have also studied the stability of various flows in geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD) and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) during my Bachelor's and Master's degree in Applied Mathematics at the University of Waterloo. The bulk of my research experience has been the numerical study of large-scale flows, including (but not restriced to) the Shallow-Water equations, the Quasi-Geostrophic equations, and their MHD counter parts (with the addition of the Lorentz force). I am particularly comfortable with pseudo-spectral methods, linear stability analysis, and energy fluxes.
