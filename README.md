## About
#### I am a reliable, dedicated and fully bilingual (Frenchâ€“English) Canadian citizen. I thrive when faced with a challenge and I perform well under pressure. I am eager to learn as I crave knowledge. I am intelligent, motivated and skilled in a variety of mathematical fields with programming experience in Python, Matlab, Julia, C/C++, Fortran, R, Maple and automation frameworks. I am currently completing a Master's degree of Mathematics (Applied Math - Fluid Mechanics) and I am looking for PhD opportunities to start in the Fall of 2022.

## Education
#### Bachelor of Mathematics in Honours Mathematical Physics at the University of Waterloo (2020).

#### Candidate for a Master of Mathematics (Applied Math) at the University of Waterloo (2022).

## Research
#### My current research interests concern the stability of various flows in Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (GFD) and Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The bulk of my research experience has been the numerical study of the Shallow-Water equations and it's MHD counter parts.

## Publications
#### Tessier, J., Castro-Folker, N., Poulin, F.J., Stastna, M. (2021). Anisotropy in Faraday Instabilities of a Shallow Conducting Fluid. Manuscript in preparation.

## Figures and Simulations
#### Nonlinear Evolution of an Unstable Bickley Jet
